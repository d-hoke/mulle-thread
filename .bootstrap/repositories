# override the repositories like so:
#    echo "https://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/repositories" > .bootstrap.local/MULLE_REPOSITORIES
#
# override the branches like so:
#    echo "master" > .bootstrap.local/MULLE_C11_BRANCH
#
# Q: Why is the branch default "release" ?
# A: When people use mulle-nat, they will most likely not hack on it, but write
# something with it. So they want to clone the stable release branch.
# If you want to hack on it, its more convenient to checkout all repositories
# and then use mulle-bootstrap -y to symlink them. That way the branch is
# ignored anyway. So win-win.
